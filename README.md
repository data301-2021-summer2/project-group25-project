## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
During a global pandemic, every country had different protocols on dealing with the situation. For many, it has become difficult to stay mentally healthy and happy while trying to obey these protocols. The World Happiness Report allows everyone to see the variations of happiness across different countries before and during the pandemic. I am interested in this dataset because I dealt with some issues with my mental health, and I know many other people in the same situation. Happiness plays a huge role in a person's life, and it would be interesting to see how everyone around the world was affected. I specifically want to explore the level of happiness before and during COVID-19, according to the country's GDP per capita. This dataset could easily be used to build a user-facing Dashboard.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
The World Happiness Report 2021 dataset showcases global happiness scores and rankings according to six categories: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. This data was provided by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. They started collecting data from each country during different years, the earliest being in 2005. From then on, the UN collected data from each country every year by using happiness scores and rankings from the Gallup World Poll, a company that specializes in conducting worldwide opinion polls. This dataset aims to track the quality of life across 150 countries while reviewing the science of measuring and understanding other peopleâ€™s happiness. This report is gaining more and more global recognition from governments and organizations because they use their datasets to form policy-making decisions. I acknowledge that this dataset does not represent the whole population of each country. I speculate that the Logged GDP per capita column will decrease for many of the countries in 2021 because of limitations caused by the global pandemic.
